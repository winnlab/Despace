				  <br>
				  <p>For us communication is the most important tool
				  in our studio and in our projects. An inquisitive and
		  		  open- minded process is of great value to us.</p>
		  		  <br>
		  		  <p>Visualizing the ideas, by giving them a material form,
				  is an important communication tool. Visualization will
		          often involve hand- drawn and digital sketches,
		          model-making and mock- ups as well as 3D visualisation
		          and detailed technical plans.</p>'
